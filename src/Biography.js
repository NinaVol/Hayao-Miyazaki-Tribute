               <h3>Early life</h3>
               <p>
               Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in Tokyo, Japan. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki, was the director of a company producing airplane rudders during World War II, which kept the family affluent. His mother, Yoshiko, was a strict, intellectual woman who suffered from spinal tuberculosis between 1947 and 1955, significantly influencing Miyazaki’s later work.
               <br/>
               In 1944, Miyazaki’s family evacuated due to bombings, which left a lasting impression on him. As a child, he struggled with health issues and self-esteem but was supported by his older brother at school. He was deeply inspired by his mother’s strength and intellect, which shaped his creative vision. Yoshiko died in 1983.
               <br/>
               Miyazaki aspired to be a manga artist but initially struggled to draw people, focusing instead on planes and tanks. He admired artists like Osamu Tezuka but avoided imitating their styles to develop his own. His interest in animation was sparked in high school by the film Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958), which deeply moved him and inspired his approach to storytelling.
               <br/>
               After graduating high school, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University, studying political science and economics but devoting much of his time to art. He graduated in 1963, having already begun exploring manga and animation, laying the foundation for his remarkable career.

                <h3>Early career</h3>
                <p>
                In 1963, Hayao Miyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist, working on projects like Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon and The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun. Despite dissatisfaction with limited creative opportunities, he transitioned to key animation roles, collaborated with Isao Takahata, and became a union leader. Influenced by The Snow Queen and his mentor Yasuo Ōtsuka, Miyazaki continued to refine his artistic approach.
                <br/>
                In the late 1960s, Miyazaki contributed to several notable works, including Puss 'n Boots and Flying Phantom Ship. He began experimenting with manga, writing People of the Desert and adaptations like Animal Treasure Island. In 1971, he left Toei Animation, joining A-Pro, where he co-directed episodes of Lupin the Third Part I and worked on unreleased projects like Pippi Longstocking. He later created Panda! Go, Panda! shorts, inspired by Japan's panda craze.
                <br/>
                By the mid-1970s, Miyazaki and Takahata worked on ambitious TV projects, including Heidi, Girl of the Alps and 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother. Miyazaki directed his first series, Future Boy Conan (1978), which showcased themes like environmentalism and aviation. His distinct style emerged through these works, blending compelling storytelling with innovative animation.

               <h3>Studio Ghibli and Early Films (1985–1995)</h3>
               <p>
                  In 1985, following the success of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata founded Studio Ghibli as a subsidiary of Tokuma Shoten. The name "Ghibli" was inspired by an Italian airplane and a desert wind, reflecting Miyazaki's love for aviation. The studio quickly grew, hiring many former colleagues from other studios. Miyazaki's first Ghibli film, Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), incorporated themes of community and environmentalism, influenced by his visits to Wales. Despite modest box office returns, the film became a cornerstone of the studio's reputation.
               <br/>
                  Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro (1988) introduced his iconic character Totoro, symbolizing harmony between humanity and nature. Initially pitched in the early 1980s but rejected, the film was eventually released alongside Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies. While not an immediate box office hit, Totoro's merchandising success sustained Studio Ghibli for years, and the film later gained international acclaim.
               <br/>
                  In 1989, Miyazaki directed Kiki's Delivery Service, a story about a young witch navigating independence. Inspired by Swedish landscapes, the film was both a critical and commercial success, becoming Japan's highest-grossing film of the year. Miyazaki also expanded into manga with Hikōtei Jidai, which served as the basis for his 1992 film Porco Rosso. Set against the backdrop of the Adriatic Sea and influenced by the Yugoslav Wars, Porco Rosso explored mature themes and anti-war messages. It became the highest-grossing Japanese film of the year.
               <br/>
                  During this period, Miyazaki designed Studio Ghibli's new facilities in Tokyo and completed the final volumes of his manga Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. He also contributed to other studio projects, including Takahata's Pom Poko and Whisper of the Heart (1995). By the mid-1990s, Studio Ghibli had firmly established itself as a powerhouse of Japanese animation, with Miyazaki at its creative helm.

                <h3>Later Films (2001–2011)</h3>
                <p>
                 In 2001, Studio Ghibli began production on Howl's Moving Castle, based on the novel by Diana Wynne Jones. Initially directed by Mamoru Hosoda, disagreements led to Miyazaki taking over the project in 2002. Inspired by the image of a moving castle, Miyazaki incorporated themes of war influenced by the Iraq invasion. Released in 2004, the film received critical acclaim, grossing ¥19.3 billion worldwide, and earned Miyazaki several awards, including the honorary Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 2005.
                <br/>
                 After Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki worked on short films for the Ghibli Museum and began production on Ponyo in 2006, inspired by The Little Mermaid. Released in 2008, the film celebrated the innocence of childhood and featured 170,000 hand-drawn frames. It grossed ¥15.5 billion, making it one of Japan's highest-grossing films. That same year, Miyazaki founded a preschool, Home of the Three Bears, for the children of Studio Ghibli employees.
                <br/>
                 In 2009, Miyazaki wrote the manga The Wind Rises, about Jiro Horikoshi, designer of the Mitsubishi Zero fighter. He also wrote and directed short films for the Ghibli Museum and produced Arrietty (2010), based on The Borrowers. The film marked Hiromasa Yonebayashi’s directorial debut. Miyazaki later co-wrote From Up on Poppy Hill (2011), directed by his son Goro, which became Japan's highest-grossing film of the year and won Animation of the Year at the Japan Academy Awards. This period solidified Miyazaki’s reputation as a master animator and storyteller.

               <h3>The Wind Rises and Later Career (2012–present)</h3>
               <p>
               After Ponyo, Miyazaki planned a sequel but was convinced to adapt his manga Kaze Tachinu into a film. Inspired by Jiro Horikoshi's life and Tatsuo Hori's novel The Wind Has Risen, The Wind Rises drew parallels to Miyazaki's own experiences and reflected his pacifist views. Released in 2013, the film earned critical acclaim and was named Animation of the Year at the 37th Japan Academy Film Prize. It grossed ¥11.6 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan that year.
               <br/>
               In 2013, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films but continued creating for the Ghibli Museum. He developed Boro the Caterpillar, an animated short released in 2017, and worked on a manga titled Teppo Samurai. In 2019, a kabuki adaptation of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind received Miyazaki's approval. The same year, the NHK documentary 10 Years with Hayao Miyazaki chronicled his creative process.
               <br/>
               n 2016, Miyazaki began work on a new feature-length film, The Boy and the Heron, without initial approval. Released in 2023, the film featured minimal marketing, focusing instead on its artistic merit. It earned Miyazaki his second Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, making him the oldest recipient of the honor. Despite claims that it would be his final film, Miyazaki continued planning new projects. In October 2023, Studio Ghibli became a subsidiary of Nippon Television Holdings, with Miyazaki serving as honorary chairman.
